# CTD Calibration Document

This document
talks about CTD data calibration and the tedious mechanisms required to reprocess and generate new data files before loading them up to the data center for publication. Blah, blah, and endless blah!</p>

### Salinity Resampling
### Oxygen and Winkler Analysis
These wordy documents are terrible to read through are they not?

- Seem to have lost a lot of content
