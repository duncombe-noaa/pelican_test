# A working concept developed

Now I have an idea how this thing works and I can start populating some things to test further. At least I have a kludgy method of getting markdown docs onto a website in a kind of bloggy fashion. 

The method is described in the readme on the github pages. Essentially it consists of 
- cloning the repository, 
- making desired edits in the master branch, usually adding content to content folder,
- running pelican 
- changing to the gh-pages branch,
- rearranging the output html pages
	- deleting everything in the top directory (except the output directory),
	- taking everything out of output and putting in the top directory.
- pushing the changes to the website (github).
