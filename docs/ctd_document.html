<h1> CTD Calibration Document </h1>

<p>This document
talks about CTD data calibration and the tedious mechanisms required to reprocess and generate new data files before loading them up to the data center for publication. Blah, blah, and endless blah!</p>
<h2> Calibration considerations </h2>
<h3> Salinity Resampling </h3>
<h3> Oxygen and Winkler Analysis </h3>
<p>These wordy documents are terrible to read through are they not? 

<ul>
<li> Can things get any more tiresome?
<li> Seem to have lost a lot of content
</ul>
